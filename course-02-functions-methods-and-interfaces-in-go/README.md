# Exercises

## Week-01

### Bubble Sort

#### PROMPT

Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program should prompt the user to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program should print the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to greatest. Use your favorite search tool to find a description of how the bubble sort algorithm works.

As part of this program, you should write a function called BubbleSort() which takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements are in sorted order.

A recurring operation in the bubble sort algorithm is the Swap operation which swaps the position of two adjacent elements in the slice. You should write a Swap() function which performs this operation. Your Swap() function should take two arguments, a slice of integers and an index value i which indicates a position in the slice. The Swap() function should return nothing, but it should swap the contents of the slice in position i with the contents in position i+1.

## Week-02

### Displacement

#### PROMPT

Let us assume the following formula for displacement s as a function of time t, acceleration a, initial velocity vo, and initial displacement so.

s =½ a t2 + vot + so

Write a program which first prompts the user to enter values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. Then the program should prompt the user to enter a value for time and the program should compute the displacement after the entered time.

You will need to define and use a function called GenDisplaceFn() which takes three float64 arguments, acceleration a, initial velocity vo, and initial displacement so. GenDisplaceFn() should return a function which computes displacement as a function of time, assuming the given values acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. The function returned by GenDisplaceFn() should take one float64 argument t, representing time, and return one float64 argument which is the displacement travelled after time t.

For example, let’s say that I want to assume the following values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement: a = 10, vo = 2, so = 1. I can use the following statement to call GenDisplaceFn() to generate a function fn which will compute displacement as a function of time.

fn := GenDisplaceFn(10, 2, 1)

Then I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 3 seconds.

fmt.Println(fn(3))

And I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 5 seconds.

fmt.Println(fn(5))
